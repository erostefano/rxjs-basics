# rxjs-callback
Some devs have difficulties in understanding the concept of callbacks in RxJS. For this reason you will find two ways of creating Observables: the short ways and the long way where everything is typed.

## Get started

Install Node.js and npm https://nodejs.org/en/ and check if the installation went well

```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
```

To run Typescript code need to install these packages https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node

```
npm install -g ts-node
```

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Then you can run the code by this

```
ts-node ./solutions/without_type.ts
```
